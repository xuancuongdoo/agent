# Agent Server Active Context

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the core infrastructure for the Agent Server, including the basic modules for planning, reasoning, memory, workflow, and action components. The initial implementation has been completed with a modular architecture that follows the diagram structure.

## Recent Changes

1. **Project Initialization**: Set up project structure with FastAPI server and modular components
2. **Core Modules Implementation**:
   - Planning module with plan generation capabilities
   - Reasoning module with OpenAI Agents integration
   - Memory module with both short-term and long-term storage
   - Workflow module for sequential task execution
   - Action module for trigger-based actions
3. **API Endpoints**: Implemented core endpoints for executing tasks, checking status, and accessing memory
4. **Package Management**: Configured uv for dependency management
5. **Documentation**: Created README with architecture diagram and usage instructions
6. **Containerization**: Added Dockerfile for containerization

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the system
2. **Implement Authentication**: Add authentication mechanisms to secure the API
3. **Add Testing**: Create unit and integration tests for all modules
4. **Enhance Planning Strategies**: Implement more sophisticated planning algorithms
5. **Extend Workflow Types**: Support parallel and conditional workflow execution
6. **Add Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and metrics collection for better observability

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **OpenAI Agents Integration**: Currently using a simplified integration approach. Considering more robust integration with the full capabilities of the OpenAI Agents library.

2. **Memory Persistence**: Currently storing memory in JSON files. Evaluating options for more scalable storage solutions like databases.

3. **Workflow Engine**: The current workflow engine supports sequential execution. Evaluating the best approach for implementing parallel and conditional workflows.

4. **API Design**: The current API design focuses on simplicity. Considering additional endpoints for more fine-grained control of agent execution.

5. **Security Model**: Deciding on the appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms for the API.

## Current Priorities

1. **Stability**: Ensure the core functionality is stable and reliable
2. **Security**: Add authentication to protect the API
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive tests to validate functionality
4. **Documentation**: Enhance documentation with more examples and usage scenarios

## Blockers and Challenges

1. **OpenAI Agents Limitations**: Working within the constraints of the current OpenAI Agents Python library
2. **Performance Testing**: Need to evaluate performance under load
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling across async operations is complex
