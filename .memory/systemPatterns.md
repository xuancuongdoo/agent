# Agent Server System Patterns

## System Architecture

The Agent Server follows a modular architecture with clearly separated components that interact through well-defined interfaces. The architecture is designed to be extensible and maintainable, allowing for future enhancements and customizations.

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **Asynchronous Execution**: The system uses Python's asyncio for asynchronous execution, allowing for non-blocking operations and improved performance.

2. **RESTful API**: The API follows RESTful principles with JSON for data exchange, making it easy to integrate with various client applications.

3. **Modular Design**: Each major component (Planning, Reasoning, Memory, Workflow, Action) is implemented as a separate module with clear responsibilities.

4. **Memory Persistence**: Memory is persisted in JSON files, with separate structures for short-term and long-term memory.

5. **Workflow Engine**: The workflow engine supports sequential execution of tasks, with future extensions planned for parallel and conditional workflows.

6. **Docker Containerization**: The system is containerized using Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale.

7. **Package Management**: The project uses uv for fast, reliable dependency management.

## Design Patterns

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Core components (Planning, Reasoning, Memory, Workflow) are implemented as singletons to ensure a single instance throughout the application.

2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different reasoning approaches can be selected based on the task requirements.

3. **Factory Pattern**: Task creation and execution is handled through factory methods that create appropriate task structures.

4. **Observer Pattern**: The workflow system notifies interested components when task status changes.

5. **Repository Pattern**: Memory acts as a repository for storing and retrieving data.

## Component Relationships

1. **Planning → Workflow**: Planning generates task queues and actions that are executed by the workflow engine.

2. **Workflow → Reasoning**: The workflow engine delegates task execution to the reasoning module.

3. **Reasoning ↔ Memory**: Reasoning components read from and write to memory during task execution.

4. **Workflow → Action**: The workflow triggers actions based on task completion and other events.

5. **API → Components**: The API serves as the entry point, coordinating the interaction between components.

## Error Handling

1. **Boundary Errors**: Errors at API boundaries are captured and returned as appropriate HTTP status codes.

2. **Component Errors**: Errors within components are logged and, where possible, handled gracefully to prevent cascading failures.

3. **Workflow Errors**: Task failures within workflows are recorded and can optionally trigger recovery actions.

## Future Architecture Considerations

1. **Database Integration**: Replace file-based memory storage with a database for better scalability and query capabilities.

2. **Advanced Workflow Patterns**: Implement more sophisticated workflow patterns, including parallel execution and conditional branching.

3. **Microservices Architecture**: Consider splitting components into separate microservices for better scalability and independent deployment.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Evolve towards a more event-driven architecture for improved decoupling and real-time processing.
