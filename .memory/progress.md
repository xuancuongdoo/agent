# Agent Server Progress

## What Works

- ✅ Project structure created with modular components
- ✅ FastAPI server setup with main endpoints
- ✅ Planning module implemented with structured plan generation
- ✅ Reasoning module implemented with OpenAI Agents integration
- ✅ Memory module implemented with short-term and long-term storage
- ✅ Workflow module implemented with sequential task execution
- ✅ Action module implemented with trigger-based execution
- ✅ Package management configured with uv
- ✅ Docker containerization added
- ✅ Basic API documentation included in the README
- ✅ Example client script for interacting with the server

## What's Left to Build

- ❌ Add proper error handling and logging
- ❌ Implement more sophisticated planning strategies
- ❌ Add authentication to the API
- ❌ Implement more complex workflow patterns (parallel, conditional)
- ❌ Add proper tests for all modules
- ❌ Enhance documentation with more examples
- ❌ Add monitoring and metrics collection
- ❌ Implement CI/CD pipeline
- ❌ Add database integration for memory storage
- ❌ Create user interface for monitoring agent execution

## Current Status

The Agent Server has a functional core implementation with all required modules. The server can execute basic agent tasks through the API, manage memory, and execute sequential workflows. The architecture is modular and allows for future extensions and enhancements. The project is at an early stage but provides a solid foundation for building AI agent systems.

Key components are implemented and functional:
- Planning module can generate structured plans
- Reasoning module can execute tasks with OpenAI Agents
- Memory module can store and retrieve information
- Workflow module can execute sequential tasks
- Action module can handle action triggers

## Known Issues

1. **OpenAI Agents Integration**: The current implementation uses a simplified approach to integrate with OpenAI Agents. A more robust integration is needed for production use.

2. **Error Handling**: The current error handling is basic and needs improvement for better debugging and resilience.

3. **Performance**: The system has not been tested with high loads or long-running tasks.

4. **Security**: No authentication or authorization mechanisms are implemented yet.

5. **Import Issues**: There are some linter errors related to imports that need to be fixed.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Import Issues**: Resolve the linter errors related to imports to ensure the codebase is clean and functional.

2. **Implement Error Handling**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the system.

3. **Add Authentication**: Implement an authentication mechanism to secure the API.

4. **Write Tests**: Create unit and integration tests for all modules to ensure reliability.

5. **Enhance Documentation**: Expand the documentation with more examples and usage scenarios.
