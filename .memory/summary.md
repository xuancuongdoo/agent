# Agent Server Memory Bank Summary

This Memory Bank contains comprehensive documentation for the Agent Server project, a modular framework for building, managing, and executing AI agent systems based on the OpenAI Agents Python library.

## Key Files

1. **projectbrief.md**: Defines the core requirements, goals, and scope of the Agent Server project, including modular architecture, REST API, and integration with OpenAI Agents.

2. **productContext.md**: Explains why the project exists, the problems it solves (execution coordination, memory management, reasoning abstraction), and the user experience goals for both developers and end users.

3. **activeContext.md**: Documents the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions being considered for the project.

4. **systemPatterns.md**: Details the system architecture, key technical decisions, design patterns, and component relationships, providing a technical blueprint for the project.

5. **techContext.md**: Describes the technologies used (Python, FastAPI, OpenAI Agents, uv), development setup, technical constraints, and deployment considerations.

6. **progress.md**: Tracks what works, what's left to build, current status, known issues, and next steps, providing a clear picture of project progress.

## Project Status

The project is in an early but functional state, with all core components implemented:
- Planning module for generating structured plans
- Reasoning module for executing tasks with OpenAI Agents
- Memory module for storing and retrieving information
- Workflow module for executing sequential tasks
- Action module for handling trigger-based actions

The immediate focus is on:
1. Fixing import issues
2. Implementing comprehensive error handling
3. Adding authentication
4. Writing tests
5. Enhancing documentation

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Agent Execution
├── Planning
├── Reasoning
├── Memory (Short-term & Long-term)
├── Workflow
└── Action
```

All components are designed to be extensible and maintainable, with a RESTful API for interaction and Docker for containerization.
