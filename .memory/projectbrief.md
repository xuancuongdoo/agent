# Agent Server Project Brief

## Project Overview

The Agent Server is a comprehensive framework for building, managing, and executing AI agent systems. The server is based on the OpenAI Agents Python library and provides a modular architecture for planning, reasoning, memory management, workflow execution, and action handling.

## Core Requirements

1. **Modular Architecture**: The system should be built with clearly separated modules for planning, reasoning, memory, workflow, and action components.

2. **REST API**: Provide a FastAPI-based REST API for interacting with the agent system.

3. **Asynchronous Execution**: Support asynchronous execution of agent tasks.

4. **Memory Management**: Implement both short-term and long-term memory capabilities.

5. **Workflow Management**: Handle sequential, parallel, and conditional workflow execution.

6. **Integration with OpenAI Agents**: Leverage the OpenAI Agents Python library for AI reasoning capabilities.

7. **Package Management**: Use uv as the primary package manager for fast, reliable dependency management.

## Project Goals

- Create a flexible framework for AI agent systems that can be used in various applications
- Provide a clean, well-documented API for interacting with the agent system
- Ensure extensibility for future enhancements and customizations
- Maintain high performance with proper async design patterns

## Project Scope

The Agent Server includes:

- A FastAPI server with endpoints for executing agent tasks, checking task status, and accessing memory
- Modules for planning, reasoning, memory, workflow, and action components
- Integration with OpenAI Agents for AI capabilities
- Documentation for system usage and extension
- Containerization support via Docker

## Success Criteria

- The server can be started and API endpoints are accessible
- Agent tasks can be executed successfully through the API
- Memory can be stored and retrieved properly
- Workflows can be executed with proper task sequencing
- The system is properly containerized for deployment

## Technical Constraints

- Python 3.10+ required
- FastAPI for API implementation
- uv for package management
- OpenAI Agents for AI reasoning capabilities
